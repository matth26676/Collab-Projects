Main Idea: Get a working tower defense where the user has to program the targeting for the towers in JavaScript.


Important:
-Server handles all game mechanics except for the clients targeting programs
-Client handles all design elements

MVP:
-Make a tower
	-Make the tower exist
	-Make the tower shoot
	-Add a temporary targeting system
	-Remove the targeting system and make the user program it
	-Create simple rules for program
	-Create key terms for the program
-Make a target
	-Make a test enemy
	-Make it possible for the tower to target it
-Make a simple map
	-Make it exist
	-Make towers exist on the map
-Make an enemy
	-Make it spawn on the map
	-Make it move along the map
	-Remove it upon exiting the map

Release:
-Make towers stop/shutdown for a set # of rounds if the program for targeting breaks the rules
-Add a UI
-Make it possible for users to transfer their code between levels and use previous programs
-Add more towers
-Add more enemy types
-Expand map
